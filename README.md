# gdb Debugging 

## first step 
This guide demonstrates how to create a simple C program with a **segmentation fault**, compile it with debugging symbols, and use **GDB** to analyze and navigate the code.

---

## 1. create a c program with a segmentation fault error 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int z = x + y;
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, z);

    int *ptr;
    *ptr=10; // This will likely cause a segmentation fault
    printf("Value at ptr: %d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```
## 2. compile with debugging symbols 

--- 
```c
gcc test_main.c -g -o main.out
```
## 3. start gdb

```c
gdb ./main.out
```
## 4. View the source code in TUI Mode(terminal user interface)
inside gdb press 
```c
ctr + x then a
```
This enables TUI (Text User Interface) mode, which shows the source code and allows navigation.

## 5. start debugging 
Start the program from the beginning by writing :
```c
start 
```
Step through the code line by line:
```c
n
```
printing variable value for example x:
```c
p x
```
also you can run the code by the following:
```c
run
```
or just type
```c
r
```
### Lets see more gdb comands (step, refresh, c, finish, bt, quit, b or break & etc)
inside the TUI if you see the code not organised write the following:
```c
refresh
```
if you want to step into a function write the following:
```c
s
```
or
```c
step
```
if you want to exit the current function:
```c
finish
```
if you want to make the program to continue:
```c
c
```
if you want to exit the gdb session:
```c
quit
```
if you want to add breakpoint:
```c
b lineNUmber
example >> b 10
```
or
```c
break 10
```



### How to get know the all set breakpoints?
```c
info breakpoints
```
### How to delete breakpoint?
after doing info breakpoints you can see the Num column, so select the one you want to delete
for example
```c
delete 2
```
if you want to delete all breakpoints:
```c
delete
```

### Also you can set a breakpoint for (function name, file name , line number)
```c
b functionName
b file1.cpp:functionName // file name + function name  
b file1.cpp:25           // file name + line number 
b 20                     // line number  
```
### Also we can add conditional breakpoint like the following:
assume we have the following code
```c

void print_message(const char *message) {
    printf("Message: %s\n", message);
}
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        print_message("Inside the loop\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
we want to add break point when i is equal to 5
```c
//b linNUmber if i==5 
b 20 if i==5
```
### If you want to print all local variables 
```c
info locals
```
### watch command
if you want to make a breakpoint at a specific variable only when its value was changed: 
```c
watch x     // puts harware breakpoint 
```
also you can make it under condition like the following:
```c
watch x==3  // put breakpoint if x value = to 3 
```

### display command 
if you want to display any variable value with every time you run any command:
```c
display x
display y
```
to see the all display variables:
```c
info display    // here you will see the all display variables and an ID for each
```
if you want to make undisplay for a specfic variable:
```c
undisplay 2     // 2 is the variable ID 
```
### How i can overwrite vraiable value?

```c
set var x=20        // set x to 20 
```
if x inside class or struct
```c
set var obj.x=50        // obj is an object from a class 
```
### calling function through gdb commands
assume function prototype is sum(x,y):
```c
call sum(5,6)   // it should execute the function  
```
### if you need to know the type of a variable or object

```c
ptype x         // vraiable name
ptype sum()     // function name 
```
or use the following
```c
whatis sum()
```
### if you need to see the code of a specific function

```c
list print_hello()
list Data::HelloWorld()     // if HelloWorld is a method from Data 
```
### if you want to show the assembly code for the source code or even for a specific function

```c
disassemble /s               // will print the whole assembly code
disassemble /s print_hello  // will print assembly code for only print_hello function 
```
 
 ### How to use backtrace command (bt)
 after program being crashed do the following:
 ```c
 bt
 ```
 or
 ```c
 backtrace
 ```
 then keep press enter to present the whole frames 
 if you want to present the code for any frame just do the following:
 ```c
 frame 1        // 1 is the frame number could be any number
 ```
 ### if you want to show the registers info 

 ```c
 info registers
 ```
 ### if you want to present the value of stack pointer (for example) rsp

 ```c
 x/32w $rsp     // 32w means 32 word you can type>>  help x/ to see the all format 
 ```
 also if you want to present the output in hexadecimal format
 ```c
 x/32wx $rsp
 ```
 ### How to attach a running process with its PID?
 first you have to get the process PID 
 ```c
 ps aux | grep processName  // for example test.out or WPEWebProcess
 ```
 then you can attach the process by two ways >> the firs 
 ```c
 gdb
 attach PID
 ```
 or
 ```c
 gdb -p PID
 ```
 after attaching the PID you can run
 ```c
 bt
 ```
 to see the running frames and you can go to specific frame through the following
 ```c
 frame FrameNumber  // frame 3 ,, 3 here for frame 3 you can find the frame number after running bt command 
 ```
then you can see the source code by pressing Ctrl + x then a (if the lib was built by using the -g )

### How to open gdb-server ?
1 - open gdbserver with specific port on the target machine 
```c
gdbserver :1234 --attach <PID>
```

## What is gdb-multiarch?

Itâ€™s a version of GDB that supports cross-debugging for multiple architectures (ARM, MIPS, RISC-V, etc.) from your PC.

Youâ€™ll need it if you want to connect to a gdbserver thatâ€™s running code built for another CPU (like ARM firmware on a router, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Install gdb-multiarch on Ubuntu/Debian
```c
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
```
2 - so on the host machine run the following 
```c
gdb-multiarch
target remote IP:PORT   // target remote 192.168.8.122:1234
```

you can do the same on the localhost through the following
1 - open terminal and write
```c
gdbserver localhost:1234 test.out       // test.out is an executable file
```
2 - open another terminal and write
```c
gdb test.out
target remote localhost:1234
```

# How to create gdb file and commands?
1 - create a file without file extension for example (gdbcommands)
```c
define testcommand
	target remote localhost:1234
	b main
	c
end
```
2 - run the following
```c
gdb thread.out -x gdbcommands   // -x to tell gdb that you will run the commands inside gdbcommands file
testcommand                     // here you tell gdb start running the commands, you can delete (define testcommand) then the commands will be run directly after entered to the gdb terminal 
```
Note: if you forget to pass the gdbcommands file at the beginning you can source it inside gdb terminal as the following
```c
source gdbcommands
```
